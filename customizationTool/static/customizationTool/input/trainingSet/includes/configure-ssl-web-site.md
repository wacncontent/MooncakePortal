		This article shows you how to configure HTTPS for a web app in Azure App Service. It does not cover client certificate authentication; for information about that, see [How To Configure TLS Mutual Authentication for Web Apps](../articles/app-service-web/app-service-web-configure-tls-mutual-auth.md).

			* IP based SSL associates a certificate with a domain name by mapping the dedicated public IP address of the server to the domain name. This requires each domain name (contoso.com, fabricam.com, etc.) associated with your service to have a dedicated IP address. This is the traditional method of associating SSL certificates with a web server.
		
			* SNI based SSL is an extension to SSL and [Transport Layer Security][tls] (TLS) that allows multiple domains to share the same IP address, with separate security certificates for each domain. Most modern browsers (including Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox and Opera) support SNI, however older browsers may not support SNI. For more information on SNI, see the [Server Name Indication][sni] article on Wikipedia.
